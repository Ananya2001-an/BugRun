# BugRun

Can use hand gestures to control the game! Run the `main.py` file in `hand-tracker-cv` folder. Used dependencies like **opencv-python** for computer vision and **mediapipe** for hand gesture tracking. 

## Demo

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ananya2001-an/BugRun.git

```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn
```    
OR
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run webpack:
```bash
npm start
```

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see the game running.
